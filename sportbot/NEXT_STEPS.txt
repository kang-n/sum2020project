What we have:

    We have found the players we are trying to access info for
    They are all currently stored in the array samenameplayers
    (These are the actual roster.Player variables that we will
    pull information from)

    The bot will currently PRODUCE a list of names like so:

    Input: !fb.player Josh Allen
    Output:
    Josh Allen 1991
    Josh Allen 1996
    Josh Allen 1997

    corresponding to all players of the same name found (w/ birthdates)

How to proceed:

    The hard part:
        
        The user needs to be able to choose which "Josh Allen"
        via typing in a command like '!1' or '!2' for the
        first and second entry respectively.

    The easier part:

        Since we already have the actual roster.Player variables stored
        in our samenameplayers array, all we need to do is just call
        and output the information we want via the API functions.
